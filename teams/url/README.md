URL Team
========

The URL team at the Ojos Project is in charge of building the device. There are
many definitions to the world "building", but eventually this team will be split
into more. As of now, this is the team that is physically present on-campus at
the University of California, Irvine.

The current responsibilities of the URL team include:

- Requirements gathering
- Interviewing individuals
- Documenting interviews and notes
- Reading over research presented by Research team
- Ensuring all of our information is in place
- Updating Professor Baldwin with everything regarding the project.

the tools we use are:
