Research Team

The Research Team at the Ojos Project is in charge of reading research papers
that may help with the development of our project. The Research Team's
responsibilities include reading academic papers and summarizing the content in
it.

Responsibilities

At the moment, there are two teams: the URL Team and the Research Team. The URL
team is at the University of California, Irvine physically present on campus.

The relationship between the two includes the following:

1. The URL team asks the Research team to research a specific topic
2. The URL team sends an academic article that requires reading
3. The Research team reads on the topic or the journal article and put their
findings on a Google Doc.
