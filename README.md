# Ojos Project

Welcome to the Ojos Project documentation! This is a collection of Markdown
files organized to help you get a better understanding of us as a team and our
work.

The Ojos Project currently has two teams:

- [Research Team](https://docs.ojosproject.org/docs/teams/research/)
- [URL Team](https://docs.ojosproject.org/docs/teams/url/)

## Contributing

If you are a member of the Ojos Project, you can add your changes to the `dev`
branch.

If you are an open-source contributor, you can create a fork of these documents
and open a
[Merge request](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/).

There is also a "Edit this page" button at the end of these documents in
[docs.ojosproject.org](https://docs.ojosproject.org/) that will take you to the
file in the GitLab repository.
