# Ojos Project Docs

Welcome to the Ojos Project documentation! This is a collection of Markdown
files organized to help you get a better understanding of us as a team and our
work.

## Contributing

The `docs.ojosproject.org` website is generated with
[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), an open-source documentation tool. It
uses all of the Markdown files in the `docs` folder and presents it in a
template used by hundreds of projects.

### Developer Guide

To run the website on your local machine, run these commands:

```shell
# install dependencies
npm i

# start the program
npm run start
```

If you make a change and don't immediately see it, it might be because the cache
is being used. To clear the cache, run:

```shell
npm run clear
```

Please refer to the [Docusaurus documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs)

### Git Rules

Please make sure to follow
[the Ojos Project git policies](https://docs.ojosproject.org/policies/git).
Thanks!
