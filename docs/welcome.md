# Welcome

Welcome to the Ojos Project documentation! This is a collection of Markdown
files organized to help you get a better understanding of us as a team and our
work.

The Ojos Project currently has three teams:

- [Developers Team](/teams/developers/)
- [Engineering Team](/teams/engineering/)
- [Research Team](/teams/research/)

## What do these docs have?

As of now, these docs have instructions for our team. We will also include
important documents such as requirements analysis, and design guides.

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute, you are more than welcomed to. Go ahead and
read the instructions in the
[GitLab repository](https://gitlab.com/ojosproject/docs) to get started.

Another way to help is by submitting issues. By clicking `Edit this button`, it
starts writing an issue for you.

## Need help?

If anything in these documents do not make sense, please contact Carlos Valdez
any way you know how, or via email at
[cvaldezh@uci.edu](mailto:cvaldezh@uci.edu). You can also
[open an issue on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/ojosproject/docs/-/issues). Thanks!
