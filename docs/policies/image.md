# Image Policies

This document will go over how to properly use the Ojos Project logos and
identity.

## Name

We are `Ojos Project`. You can describe us as "the Ojos Project", but when
it comes to signing paperwork with our name, we are `Ojos Project`.

## Font

Our logo uses the [Inter font](https://github.com/rsms/inter).

## Logos

### General Logo

### Logo for circular frame

This logo is best for a circular frame. It has more space around it so it can
"breathe". Circular frames are often used for social media, or the clickable
logo on this website next to "Docs" above.

### Header

This is a header with "Ojos Project" next to the logo. We often use this in our
software documentation or in our meta tags header.
