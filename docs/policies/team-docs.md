# Team Docs

Team Docs refers to the sections of the Docs website (`docs.ojosproject.org`)
that are meant to be for team reference. For example,
`docs.ojosproject.org/teams/research/` is the team docs for the Research team.

These docs are meant to be updated by team leaders. They are meant for two
purposes:

1. Keep the team informed of tools to use and guides
2. Keep the public informed about how the team works

Keeping things documented is essential and should not be underestimated.

## Where is my team doc?

| Team        | Path                  | Updater       |
| ----------- | --------------------- | ------------- |
| Developers  | `/teams/developers/`  | Carlos Valdez |
| Engineering | `/teams/engineering/` | Joseph Sweatt |
| Research    | `teams/research`      | N/A           |

## How do I update the document?

The easiest way to do this is by using the GitLab IDE. [We have a guide for how
to use it](/teams/developers/guides/gitlab-ide/).

The important part is to make sure you are switched into the `dev` branch. The
document goes over that too.

## Resources

The documentation is written in Markdown. [This website is very useful for
referencing Markdown.](https://quickref.me/markdown)
