# Getting Started in the Research Team

Welcome to the Ojos Project's Research team! We're excited to have you! These
are instructions for people who are just joining the team.

## Protocols

When you find an article, you should save a PDF and place it in the
[PDFs folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KI2TzU9IiIxW-12PeD3PIpQ0SD_T1nq0).
Then, take notes using the Master Doc.

## Master Doc Structure

View the
[Master Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NK4KhvDtAmVT-2tfs4LrsvgLWV4tUc-RgwHvG7LeYDs/)
and tell Carlos if there's anything you don't understand.
