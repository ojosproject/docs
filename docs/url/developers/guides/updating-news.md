# Publishing News

The Ojos Project has
[a News section on our main website](https://ojosproject.org/news/) that is
meant to update people interested in the Ojos Project. This guide will help you
figure out how to update the site.

We will be using:

| Tool                                             | Description                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [GitLab IDE](/url/developers/guides/gitlab-ide/) | A [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)-like environment. Easier to use since it authenticates with your GitLab account. |
| [Markdown](https://quickref.me/markdown)         | The markup language used to write posts                                                                                      |
| [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) (Optional)    | A diagraming tool                                                                                                            |

## Getting Started

To initiate the GitLab IDE session, you need to go to the repository of
`ojosproject.org`.
[This link will take you directly to the `news` folder of that repository](https://gitlab.com/ojosproject/website/-/tree/dev/news/).
Once you're here, you need to press the `.` key on your keyboard to open the
GitLab IDE.

In this folder, you will find an `authors.yml` file and folders representing
years.

### `authors.yml`

:::warning

The `authors.yml` file is auto-generated. Please do not change it.

:::

The `authors.yml` file includes information about members of the Ojos Project.
All of the information that is included is from the information [we already
publish of our members](/url/members/).

The important thing to know about this file is that you're identified by your
email. For example, if Carlos wanted to author a news post, he'd set the
`authors` key as `cvaldezh@uci.edu`.

### Folders and Post Dates

Everything else in the `news` folder is just folders representing years. This is
not an accident.

The main website uses Docusaurus, and the News section uses the Blog plugin
of Docusaurus. Folders are in years for the purpose of giving them post dates.
If you go inside the folder, you will see that the names of the Markdown files
are in the format of `MM-DD-name.md`. Docusaurus will use the folder name to get
the post year, and the name of the file to get the post month and day.

So if you want to post something on April 8 and you want to name the file
`cool-post.md`, you need to name the file `04-08-cool-post.md` and place it
inside the `2024` folder.

## Docusaurus + Markdown

### Front Matter

In the beginning of almost every Markdown file, you will find something like
this:

```yaml
---
authors: cvaldezh@uci.edu
slug: /winter-2024-wrap/
hide_table_of_contents: true
description: >
  The 2024 Winter quarter is almost finished! As we get ready to wrap up for
  Spring break, let's go over some of the accomplishments we had this quarter,
  as well as the plans we have for Spring 2024. Be back soon!
---
```

The above is an example from the [Winter 2024 Wrap Up](https://ojosproject.org/news/winter-2024-wrap/)
post we made in March.

|Key|Description|
|---|---|
|`slug`|The content after `ojosproject.org/news/`. Keep it short and simple. MUST BE INCLUDED.|
|`hide_table_of_contents`|Almost always set to `true`.|
|`description`|This is just a description of the content you wrote. It's best to write something as search engines like this.|

If you collaborated with someone on an article, you can have more than one
author. You can do so by doing:

```yaml
---
authors:
    - email1
    - email2
---
```

### Truncating

Truncating indicates when the "preview" of an article should stop. Let's take
the same Winter 2024 Wrap Up as an example.

```markdown
# Winter 2024 Wrap Up

![Ojos Project header](https://docs.ojosproject.org/img/header.png)

The 2024 Winter quarter is almost finished! As we get ready to wrap up for Spring break, let's go over some of the accomplishments we had this quarter, as well as the plans we have for Spring 2024. Be back soon!

<!-- truncate -->

## A look back

### Interviews
...
...
...
```

If you look at [the main news page](https://ojosproject.org/news/) of the Ojos
Project, the Winter 2024 Wrap Up's preview ends at the spot the truncate
indicator is.

All you have to do is add the extra `<!-- truncate -->` line, and then
you can keep writing.

:::warning

This part is very important. Without the truncate indicator, the **full**
article in the News section will be displayed.

:::

### Simple Tables

[Markdown lets people make tables](https://quickref.me/markdown#tables)! It's a
neat feature to use sometimes.

Here's the basic syntax:

```markdown
|Column 1 Name|Column 2 Name|
|---|---|
|Content for column 1|Content for column2|
```

This will create:

|Column 1 Name|Column 2 Name|
|---|---|
|Content for column 1|Content for column2|

### Adding images

Images can be added by using this simple syntax:

```markdown
![Alt text for accessibility](link to the image)
```

Adding an image from your computer may be a bit difficult, and it's best to ask
someone in the Developers team for help.

However, if you want to try...

In the website repository, go to `/static/images/` and place your image there.
Next, come back to your Markdown file, and use this syntax:

```markdown
![Alt text for accessibility](@site/static/images/your-pic.png)
```

If you're using the Markdown Preview feature, you might not be able to see the
image. That's normal. It'll be available on the website. Again, Developers team
will have to review and fix any issues, so don't worry too much about this.

### Diagrams

Diagrams are made with Mermaid. This can be pretty difficult to create, but it's
probably a good idea to bring it up. A great thing about these diagrams, though,
is that they're very high quality and adaptive.

Mermaid allows people to create a lot of different diagrams in Markdown. Some
diagrams that can be made with Mermaid includes:

- [Flowcharts](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/flowchart.html)
- [Class Diagrams](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/classDiagram.html)
- [Gantt](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/gantt.html)
- [Gitgraph](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/gitgraph.html) ([Here's a live example in the Git policies](/policies/git/#branching))

Using Mermaid can be tedious as the syntax can be somewhat strict. You can use
[this Mermaid live editor](https://mermaid.live/) to view your changes before
adding it to the Markdown file.

## Finishing Up

Let's say you finally have your post ready to go. Great! But what's next?

Well, you need to commit it to the repository.

![Explore in GitLab IDE with cursor hovering Source Control](@site/static/img/screenshot-news-commit.png)

Click the `+` button on all of the files you added, write a commit message, and
then click `Commit`. Let the Developers team you committed, and you're good to
go!

## FAQs

### I finished and committed, but I don't see my post

This is normal. Someone on the Developers team needs to review it before it is
posted.

### I made a mistake. Now what?

Let someone on [the Developers team](/url/developers/) know. They have to review
the news posts before they're published anyways, so don't worry!
