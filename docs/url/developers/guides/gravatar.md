    Gravatar sets a photo for you. We use Gravatar's services to show your photo
    so that you can change it whenever you want instead of having to rely on
    the Developers to set it for you.

# Gravatar

Gravatar (otherwise known as a **g**lobally **r**ecognized **avatar**) is a
service that let's you change your photo whenever you want and immediately gets
updated on our website. This is incredibly useful and convenient for both users
and developers since users can update their photo immediately at their
discretion, and developers don't have to focus on needing to change it.

## Setting a Gravatar

To set your Gravatar, you need to [go to their website](https://gravatar.com/)
and set up an account. You'll then need to add a photo and select it as the main
photo for your email. You must use an
[approved email domain](/url/getting-started#send-us-your-email).

## Privacy Concerns

Although the Ojos Project uses Gravatar to give you a photo on the website, we
aren't the only ones to do that. There are various other services that use
Gravatar, such as (but not limited to):

- [Canvas](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Student-Guide/How-do-I-add-a-profile-picture-in-my-user-account-as-a-student/ta-p/518#from_gravatar)
- [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/personalizing-your-profile#changing-your-profile-picture)
- GitLab
- [Slack](https://slack.com/help/articles/115005506003-Upload-a-profile-photo)
- [Zulip](https://zulip.com/help/change-your-profile-picture)

This may be something to take into consideration when setting a Gravatar. You
don't have to have it be a picture of your face.

## What if I don't add a Gravatar?

If you don't want to add a Gravatar, that's totally okay too! If you don't, your
photo will just be this on our websites:
