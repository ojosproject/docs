    We use a lot of command line interface (CLI) tools, but sometimes it's nice
    to have a graphical user interface (GUI) instead. This document will outline
    different tools you can use instead of the CLIs.

# Using GUIs instead of CLIs

For the most part, developers use CLI tools. A CLI is a **c**ommand **l**ine
**i**nterface. However, sometimes it might be more comfortable to use something
more graphic, such as a GUI. A GUI is a **g**raphical **u**ser **i**nterface.

Personally, I prefer CLIs, but I understand if that isn't your cup of tea. If
that's the case, then this guide is for you!

| CLI                         | GUI Alternative                               | WSL Instructions                      |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| [Git](https://git-scm.com/) | [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) | [Read below](#git-and-github-desktop) |

:::tip

If there is a CLI that we're using but doesn't have a GUI alternative here,
please contact Carlos! It might just be that this guide is outdated and needs
to include the missing tool.

:::

:::warning

The rest of the documentation in this website will only include instructions for
CLIs. If you have an issue with the GUI tool you're using, please contact Carlos
or someone in [the Developers team](/url/developers/) directly for help.

## Git and GitHub Desktop

When it comes to coding, we use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for source control.
The Git CLI can be complicated to learn, so GitHub developed a GUI for it called
[GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). It's pretty useful and includes
most of the features we use the CLI for.
