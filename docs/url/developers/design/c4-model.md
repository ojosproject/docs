# C4 Model

## Getting Started

A [C4 Model](https://c4model.com/) is a useful way to outline the software
architecture of a system. We're going to be using this model to get a clearer
idea of how Iris is going to interact with Linux and other hardware devices that
may be installed.

### Gaphor

[Gaphor](https://gaphor.org/) is an open-source modeling platform. We're going
to be using it to make our C4 Model diagrams.

### The `.gaphor` file

Our C4 Model is going to be on a file called `c4.gaphor`. This file is going
to be located in the
[Docs repository](https://github.com/ojosproject/docs/blob/main/static/data/url/developers/c4.gaphor)
in `/static/data/url/developers/c4.gaphor`. I recommend opening the file from
that path so that the file gets updated every time you run `git pull`.

### Resources

If you'd like to learn how to use Gaphor, [their website includes various
tutorials that may be useful to view](https://gaphor.org/tutorials).

## Diagrams

You can [download the C4 Model here](https://docs.ojosproject.org/data/url/developers/c4.gaphor)
and open it in [Gaphor](https://gaphor.org/).
