Engineering Team
==================

Welcome to the Engineering Team at the Ojos Project. We are in charge of design and manufacuring of the
physcial device used by our users. We will utilize the research given by the research team in the
conisderation of our design. Responsibilites include digital design and recording of verision
iteration. Additionally, we help in contribution of the code that will be installed on the kiosk

Responsibilities
----------------

At the moment there are 3 teams working under the project: the Developers team, the Engineering team,
and the Research teams.

As a part of the Engineering Team we utilize the research given to us by the Research team to determine
constraints in the designs. Furthermore, any information or questions that are needed to be review are 
passed to the Research Team to be ascertained.
    E.g Design features that can make our device AOTA Complaint? What materials should be advoided for 
    healthcare use?

The engineering team will ocnsult with the Developers team on the software of the device to ensure that
they can request features be implemented in the physical construction. E.g Camera for video use. It 
also allows the engineering team to make contributions to the software use, i.e we will suggest programs
the device will need to be able to accomplish such as voice reconigition and AI implementation.
