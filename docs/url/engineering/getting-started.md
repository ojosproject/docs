# Getting Started in the Engineering Team

[Raspberry Software](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/raspberry-pi-desktop/) will be used 
throughout the kiosk. The link takes you to the download link to install on your computer 
operating system. We can run it as a virtual machine to iterate the code.

[Solidworks](https://laptops.eng.uci.edu/engineering-software/solidworks-student-engineering-kit-for-hssoe-students) is a vital 3D software we will use to virtual design our kiosk. This link will take you to download the software using
UCI student engineering kit. Addiitonally, fo memeber who may not have a powerful enough laptop
or are not UCI student can use [Onshape](https://www.onshape.com/en/sign-up) which is a web browser CAD software that is
free for students. 

If you have any questions please reach out to the Engineering Team Lead's help.
