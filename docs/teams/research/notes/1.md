# Tell Us: A Web-Based Tool for Improving Communicat...

## Information

Notes on "Tell Us: A Web-Based Tool for Improving Communication Among Patients, Families, and Providers in Hospice and Palliative Care Through Systematic Data Specification, Collection, and Use". See the [internal Google Drive document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k0dTcPhjcFmp60jwTHyIBwaQUM2ZNLTa/).

## Summary

This document went over a product that is similar to what we're trying to build. It focuses on Patient Recorded Outcomes, a pain diary, quality of information, etc. The Tell Us study is something we're probably going to be getting a lot of information from.

The biggest differences for us is that we aren't going to be web-based... then again that depends on how the requirements go.
