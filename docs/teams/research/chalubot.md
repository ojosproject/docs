ChaluBot is the product of the [Credit via Git proposal](/teams/research/git-credit/).

## How to use this bot

Let's say Carlos found a research paper for you. Carlos will use the command
`/assign <member> <paper id>` to assign you a paper.

Take notes on whatever device you use, as long as they're bullet point notes.
Once you've taken your notes, write a summary. Finally, run `/add_notes <paper id>`. You will get to paste your notes and summary there.

Don't know what the `<paper id>` is? Run `/list` to check!

Once you added your notes and you think they're ready to be properly added to
`docs.ojosproject.org`, run `/commit <paper id>` to mark it as finished.

Want to work on another paper? Check `/list` and use `/claim <paper id>` to
claim another paper.

So, in summary,

1. Get assigned with `/assign`, or `/claim` a paper
2. Paste your notes and summary with `/add_notes`
3. Mark as finished with `/commit`
