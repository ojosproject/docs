# Researching and Reporting Your Findings

The Ojos Project puts all of our findings in
[this internal Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NK4KhvDtAmVT-2tfs4LrsvgLWV4tUc-RgwHvG7LeYDs/).
The document is pretty self-explanatory, but I'll go into details real quick.

## Situation 1: There's a document linked, but no "Quick takeaways"

That's a document you should read! All documents that have an empty "Quick
takeaways" column means they have not been looked into.

Go ahead and read the document, and put any of your quick findings in that
column using bullet-point lists.

## Situation 2: All columns have been filled

> These topics have been updated on February 15, 2024. If you think it's been
too long, please contact Carlos and let him know he should update this list.
Thank you!

If all columns have been filled, this is where you can try to look into what to
research on your own. Try to look up something like...

- "Patient Recorded Outcomes and their effectiveness"
- "Computers in hospice environments"
- "Computers and degenerative diseases"

If it's something that you think will contribute to the project, please read it
and put it in the Master Research Doc!

Remember, we are trying to build a device that will help improve the hospice
experience for caregivers in hospice and assist in making hospice patients more
independent using computing. Anything that has to do with this may just be
useful.

## How to read a research paper

Research papers are often full of complicated languages and can be very long.
Reading them can easily become tedious. To make this easier, here's a strategy
I learned:

### Read the conclusion first

The conclusion will summarize the entire paper in just a few paragraphs. Often,
it'll contain language such as, "In this paper, we proved..."

Reading the conclusion can be a great way to figure out whether or not the paper
is actually related to our topic or not.

### Read the abstract

When you finish reading the conclusion and think it's worth to continue reading,
continue with the abstract.

### Everything else

If you still think it's worth reading, keep going! Remember to jot down your
findings using the Master Research Doc I linked above.
