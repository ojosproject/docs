# Stakeholders Analysis

:::info

This document is a work in progress and is not yet finalized. As with all
requirements analysis, this is iterative.

:::

Stakeholders are individuals that influence a system's requirements or are
impacted by that system. Identifying who the stakeholders are and what their
goals/priorities are early-on is important as it can help guide us with what we
need to look into or research. See [Current Unknowns](#current-unknowns).

## Pictoral Graph

This is still being worked on. ✍️

## Textual Analysis

The textual analysis includes various stakeholders who will, in one way or
another, have some kind of interaction with the device. Each stakeholder will
have a priority, relation to other stakeholders, area of expertise, and primary
concerns. **This is an iterative process, so information will change
constantly.**
