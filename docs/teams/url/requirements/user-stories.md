User stories are ways to express requirements in one or two sentences.

## Examples

### User Stories

An example from Software Process Management:

User story: "As a traveler, I want to cancel my reservation."

Requirements:

- a premium member can cancel the same day without a fee
- a non-premium member is charged 10% for a cancellation
- an email confirmation is sent out
- the hotel is notified of any cancellation

### Scenerios

> While Blake is searching the Internet to find out
if there are any local theaters playing a newly
released independent film, he finds the profile
page for the film which is also released on
MyFlix. Excited that he can watch it and similar
films in the comfort of his apartment, he
creates an account and begins paying the
regular monthly fee. He accesses his account
from his TVâ€™s browser and is able to stream the
movie.
