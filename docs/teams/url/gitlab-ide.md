# Using the GitLab Web IDE

If you want to make a quick edit, you can use the
[GitLab Web IDE](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/web_ide/). You can do
by going into the repository you want to edit, let's say the
[Ojos Project Docs](https://gitlab.com/ojosproject/docs), and pressing `.`. It
will automatically open up a Visual Studio Code-like coding environment for you
to use.

:::tip

Remember that at the bottom of every page, there is a "Edit this page" button.
Click that button, press `.`, and you'll be opened to that specific page in the
GitLab Web IDE.

## Switching to `dev`

When you are going to add something to any project, please make sure to switch
to the `dev` branch. At the bottom of the screen next to "GitLab", there is a
branch icon either labeled `main` or `dev`. Please switch to `dev`.
