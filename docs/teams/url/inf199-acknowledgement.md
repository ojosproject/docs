This document is intended for individuals who attend the University of
California, Irvine.

Per the [UCI General Catalogue](https://catalogue.uci.edu/allcourses/in4matx/):

> **IN4MATX 199. Individual Study. 2-5 Units.**
>
> Individual research or investigation under the direction of an individual
> faculty member.
>
> Repeatability: May be repeated for credit unlimited times.

Some individuals in the Ojos Project are participating for UCI credit under the
course IN4MATX 199. When Carlos first started the Ojos Project in October, he
was required to enroll in the course to ensure he sticks to the
[Undergraduate Research Lab](https://markbaldw.in/url) and takes it seriously.

However, enrolling in Informatics 199 isn't an option for everybody since
enrolling requires extra grading and responsibility instead of allowing them
maximum flexibility.

## Benefits of enrolling in 199

Individuals enrolled in Informatics 199 get a 2-5 unit course grade.

## Benefits of not enrolling in 199

Individuals not enrolled in Informatics 199 are allowed freedom to move in and
out of the project as they please. Individuals enrolled in 199 have to stick
with the project for a minimum two-quarter commitment.

## The Cutoff

Ojos Project members who joined after **March 5, 2024** are not eligible to
enroll in IN4MATX 199 for this project until we get further authorization to do
so.

Ojos Project members who joined after **October 31, 2023** might be eligible to
enroll in IN4MATX 199 for this project if that specific person gets authorized
to do so.

That is to say, it isn't impossible, but I wouldn't hold my breath. We apologize
for any inconvenience this may cause.
