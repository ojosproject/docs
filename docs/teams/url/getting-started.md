# Getting Started in the URL Team

Welcome to the Ojos Project's URL team! We're excited to have you! These are
instructions for people who are just joining the team.

## GitLab

We have a [GitLab organization](https://gitlab.com/ojosproject/)! In it, we have
all of our repos and documentation for the Ojos Project. It may be useful to
join it.

### SSH Setup

To connect to GitLab, you will be required to use SSH. Please read
[SSH Setup](/teams/url/ssh-setup/) to get started.

## Undergraduate Research Lab

The Ojos Project is operated under the Undergraduate Research Lab operated by
Professor Mark S. Baldwin. We have practically full control over what happens in
this project, though.

Since we're under URL, we have access to a physical lab on campus located at
Donald Bren Hall (DBH) 5089.

On the Google Calendar, you will be invited to attend events for the Ojos
Project. Anything time on the calendar for Ojos means that the lab is reserved
for us. You can come in during this time as long as the event is there. You can
work on Ojos, or you can work on any personal things.

## Unix-like Environments

The URL team will primarily use Unix-like operating systems. This includes
macOS, Linux, or the Windows Subsystem for Linux. If you don't use macOS or
Linux, please read
[Installing the Windows Subsystem for Linux](/teams/url/installing-wsl/).

## GPG & Encryption Keys

The URL team is currently doing requirements analysis, and part of that includes
conducting interviews. For the security of the interviewees, we encrypt the
content of the interviews. Authorized URL team members are given access to these
encryption keys.

You must also install `gpg`. The install process for that, as well as
instructions for decrypting the interviews, is here:
[Decrypting the Interviews](/teams/url/decrypt-interviews/)

## Admin Checklist

This checklist is here for the people helping you get set up.

- [ ] Ensure they are in the GitLab organization
  - [ ] Ensure they can connect to GitLab with SSH
- [ ] Ensure they have a Unix-like environment
- [ ] Provide access to encryption keys, if needed
  - [ ] Ensure they can decrypt interviews
